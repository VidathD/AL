# Use of Python Programming to Develop Algorithms

## Understanding the Problem

If a task is not carried out as expected in a certain place of an establishment, it can be identified as a problem. Specially, more attention is paid to the places connected with generation of information.

Let's identify what a problem means within an establishment.
- If the owner doesn't receive the information pertaining to profit and loss, it is a problem.
- If the information of students cannot be obtained easily by the head of the school, it is a problem.

Reasons for these instances maybe because of weaknesses of the existing information system. Several such weaknesses are as follows.
- Inadequate staff.
- Huge amount of data to be processed. 
- Errors of calculations.
- Carelessness.

Studying the facts such as,
- present stage of the above identified problem
- the reasons for the problem to be created
as well as,
- the relevant environment for the problem
can be mentioned as understanding the problem.


## Definition of Problem and Boundaries

If a problem as mentioned above exists and a computerized system for the problem is to be prepared, what is the information that should be entered into the computer and what should be obtained from the computer and who require that information, etcâ€¦ should be identified. These are the limitations.


## Planning the Solution

On the analysis of the problem, ways to solve it should be sought. There may be more than one method to solve a problem. We should try to find the most suitable solution from the many solutions identified.
