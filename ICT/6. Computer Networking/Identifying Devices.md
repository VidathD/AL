A logical address (IP Address) is not a permanent one. It is used temporarily. But if necessary, even a permanent address could be obtained.

But physical address (MAC Address) is entered by the manufacturer of the relevant device. 


# MAC Address

A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a physical address assigned by the device manufacturer and helps to identify the device uniquely within the network. The circuit to which the MAC address is entered is called the network interface card (NIC).

MAC address consists of 6 parts of binary values with 48 bits and has 8 bit parts.
- E.g: `00:14:22:3D:4F:52`

First 3 parts of the MAC address are used to identify the manufacturer of the relevant device. The last 3 parts are used to identify the identity of the device.

A separate unique number has been given to the companies that produce the network device and computer separately, to identify those companies.


## Frames

The unit of data created within the datalink layer is called a frame. The data packets taken from the network layer are referred to as a packet of data. Then the data available in the frame is forwarded to the physical layer, bit by bit.
