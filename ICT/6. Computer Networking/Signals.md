# Analog Signals

## Advantages of Analog Signals

- A low bandwidth is used.
- The accuracy is high.

## Disadvantages of Analog Signals

- A higher cost is needed when directing to a transmission media.

# Digital Signals

## Advantages of Digital Signals

- Integrated Circuits are used to develop digital signals.
- Having the ability of multiplexing.
- Easy to analyse.
- Troubleshooting and correcting errors can easily be done in digital signals.
- Can be reproduced without changing the original signal.

## Disadvantages of Digital Signals

- Errors may occur when converting analog signals to digital signals.
- A higher bandwidth is required in transmission of digital signals.


# Properties of Signals

1. Amplitude – Height of the wave.
2. Frequency – The number of waves that passes a fixed place in the given amount of time.

3. Wave length – The distance between adjacent heads (crests) \[or troughs\] of the wave. 
4. Phase – Existence of transmission signal of a wave for a certain time.

# Propagation Speed in a Media

Time spent to reach a certain direction through a media used to transmit data is called propagation speed in media. This speed changes according to the transmission media.

# Data Transmission Modes

There is a categorization according to the methodology of transmission of data from sender to receiver.

1. Simplex Mode – Transmitting data from sender to receiver, towards only a single direction.
    - Telecasting and broadcasting of television and radio channels.
    - ![Simplex.svg](assets/images/Simplex.svg)
2. Half-Duplex Mode – This as the ability to transmit data in both directions and if the data is transmitted towards a single direction at a single occasion, it is called half-duplex mode.
    - Talk via walkie-talkie.
    - ![Half-Duplex](assets/images/Half-Duplex.svg)
3. Full-Duplex Mode – In full-duplex mode, data transmission occur in both directions at the same time.
    - Telephone
    - ![Full-Duplex](assets/images/Full-Duplex.svg)

# Data Transmission

![assets/images/Data transmission methods.png](assets/images/Data%20transmission%20methods.png)

## Serial Data Transmission

- Data is transmitted in bits, flowing one bit after another through the transmission media is called serial data transmission.
- One wire of the transmission media is sufficient for this.
- Normally used in long distance data transmission.

## Parallel Data Transmission

- Multiple data bits transmitting over multiple channels at the same time is parallel data transmission.
- Therefore, data transmit much faster than the serial data transmission.

## Data Transmission Units

There are several units to measure data transmission. 

1. Bits per second – bps
2. Kilo bits per second – Kbps
3. Mega bits per second – Mbps

## Data Transmission Media

In data transmission, the media used to carry data from source (sender) to receiver is called data transmission media.
