# Analog Signals

## Advantages of Analog Signals

- A low bandwidth is used.
- The accuracy is high.

## Disadvantages of Analog Signals

- A higher cost is needed when directing to a transmission media.

# Digital Signals

## Advantages of Digital Signals

- Integrated Circuits are used to develop digital signals.
- Having the ability of multiplexing.
- Easy to analyse.
- Troubleshooting and correcting errors can easily be done in digital signals.
- Can be reproduced without changing the original signal.

## Disadvantages of Digital Signals

- Errors may occur when converting analog signals to digital signals.
- A higher bandwidth is required in transmission of digital signals.


# Properties of Signals

![](assets/images/Properties%20of%20a%20wave.png)

1. Amplitude – Height of the wave.
2. Frequency – The number of waves that passes a fixed place in the given amount of time.

3. Wave length – The distance between adjacent heads (crests) \[or troughs\] of the wave. 
4. Phase – Existence of transmission signal of a wave for a certain time.

# Propagation Speed in a Media

Time spent to reach a certain direction through a media used to transmit data is called propagation speed in media. This speed changes according to the transmission media.
