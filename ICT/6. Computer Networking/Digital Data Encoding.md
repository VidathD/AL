# Modulation Techniques

![Modulation](assets/images/Modulation.svg)

Carrier waves should be used to transmit data between two locations. A carrier wave is a wave that flows through a transmission media and which is used to carry data.

Data that is available as an electronic wave should be entered into the transmission media. For that, the data available in the source of data should be connected to carrier waves. When doing so, the carrier wave or the high frequency wave should be created by changing the frequency, amplitude, and phase of the wave. This process is called modulation.

The process of modulation is divided into two portions as digital and analog due to the reason of availability of digital as well as analog data on certain occasions. 


# Analog Data Modulation

## Amplitude Modulation (AM)

Changing the height of the wave on each occasion to suit the transmitted electronic wave (data) is called amplitude modulation.

<u>Advantages:</u>
- It is very easy to modulate and demodulate.
- Low cost.

<u>Disadvantages:</u>
- May be affected by external noise during transmission.

## Frequency Modulation (FM)

The carrier wave that is created by increasing the amount of waves at locations where the voltage of the transmittable wave available in the source of data device is high and decreasing the number of wave frequency at the locations where the voltage is low is called frequency modulation.
