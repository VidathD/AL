Collecting necessary data and entering them into the computer is related to this step.

Data gathering methods can be defined as,
1. Manual methods
2. Semi-automatic methods
3. Automatic methods

# Manual Data Gathering

- Observation, interviews (viva), questionnaires and sample document collection (using existing books, etcâ€¦) are the main manual methods of data gathering.

# Semi-automatic and Automatic Data Gathering

[OMR Optical Mark Recognition](#OMR%20Optical%20Mark%20Recognition), [OCR Optical Character Recognition](#OCR%20Optical%20Character%20Recognition), [MICR Magnetic Ink Character Recognition](#MICR%20Magnetic%20Ink%20Character%20Recognition), Card Readers, [Magnetic Strip Readers](#Magnetic%20Strip%20Readers), [Barcode Readers](#Barcode%20Readers), [Sensors](#Sensors), and Loggers are popular in this area.

## OMR (Optical Mark Recognition)

An OMR device or Optical Mark Reader is a scanning device that reads carefully placed pencil marks on a specially designed from.

The most popular use of OMR is marking of MCQ answer sheets.

## OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

An OCR device or an Optical Character Reader allows us to identify written or printed characters and extract editable text from it.

## MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition)

A MICR device, or Magnetic Ink Character Reader, supports to input data written in special magnetic ink under cheques.

## Magnetic Strip Readers

Magnetic Strip Reader is used to read data stored in magnetic strip attached on credit cards and ATM cards.

## Barcode Readers

Uses visible light to scan barcodes that contain data and input it to the computer.

## Sensors

These are helpful for collecting data from different places into a single data centre.
