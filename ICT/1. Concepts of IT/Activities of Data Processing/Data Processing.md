# Batch Processing

In batch processing, data input and processing occur as batch. It is easy to handle huge amounts of data as a batch. So, data is stored until the system comes online to process the data in one batch.

Examples for batch processing:
- Payroll systems
- Billing systems

# Real Time Processing

Data input, processing and output as well as storage occur simultaneously.

Examples for real time processing:
- Banking systems
- Monitoring systems
- Aircraft autopilot
- Computer controlled systems such as automatic production lines
- Booking systems
- Nuclear power station control systems
