# Transverse Waves

When the particle reaches the extreme position, it's velocity becomes 0 and the time taken by it to reach this extreme position. This is because it's velocity goes on decreasing as it goes towards the extreme position and goes on increasing as it comes to the mean position.

The particles remain executing simple harmonic motion about the mean position and the disturbance or wave travels forward from particle to particle.

The wave motion in which the particles of the medium vibrate about their mean positions at right angles to the direction of propagation of the wave is called a progressive transverse wave. 

These waves travel in the form of crest and trough. The distance between 2 successive crests or 2 successive troughs is called wave length. 

Transverse waves can propagate only in that medium which has the tendency to oppose the change of it's shape. Transverse waves can be produced only in that medium which has rigidity or elasticity of shape.

Since all solids and the surface of liquid have the tendency to oppose the change of their shapes, transverse waves can propagate only in solids and on the surface of liquids.

Transverse waves can't propagate through gasses and interior of liquids. So they do not have the elasticity of shapes.

All electromagnetic waves are transverse in nature. 


1. Give the relationship between frequency, velocity and wavelength. $$v=f\lambda$$
2. The audible frequency of ear is 20Hz to 20000Hz. Convert this to corresponding wavelength range. Take the speed of wave at ordinary temperature to be 340ms$^{-1}$.
$$\begin{aligned}& v=f\lambda \\ \\ & \text{At 20Hz,} \\ & 340 = 20 \lambda \\ & \lambda = 17m \\ \\ & \text{At 20000Hz} \\ & 340 = 20000\lambda \\ & \lambda=0.017m \end{aligned}$$

3. What is the wavelength of sound in medium in which the speed of sound is 2.4kms$^{-2}$. The frequency of sound is 3kHz.
$$\begin{aligned} & v = f\lambda \\ & 2400ms^{-1} = 3000Hz\lambda \\ & \lambda=0.8m\end{aligned}$$

4. A source emits ultrasonic sound of 20kHz. This sound falls on water surface. Calculate the wavelength of the,
   1. reflected sound 
   2. Transmitted sound.
Given sound of air = 340ms$^{-1}$, speed of sound in water = 1480ms$^{-1}$.
$$\begin{aligned}& \text{For reflected,}\\ & v=f\lambda \\ & 340 = 20000\lambda \\ & \lambda=0.017m 
 \\ & \\ & \text{For absorbed,} \\ & v=f\lambda \\ & 1480 = 20000\lambda \\ & \lambda=0.074m\end{aligned}$$

## Superposition of Pulses

2 Pulses can overlap in the same region of space. Where the 2 waves coincide, they add together. The resulting pulse is given by the sum of these pulses.
